    \bfseries\Large CSMC Resume Critique Program
\end{center}

\section{Disclaimer}\label{section:disclaimer}

If at any point you provide your contact information outside the confines of
this program, you are responsible for any messages and/or spam you
receive.\label{section:disclaimer:spamMessages}

\section{Problem Statement}

The recent tech crash has made it difficult to:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item find internship and full-time opportunities.
    \item compete with others for the same position.
    \item provide a good first impression.
\end{enumerate}

Even when it does recover, the space will continue to be more competitive.

\section{Mission Statement}

The goal is to provide eligible current (and even former) mentors an opportunity
to improve their resume and therefore provide a good first impression.

\section{Participation Requirements}

You are considered eligible to recieve a resume critique if and only if you meet
at least 1 of the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Shift Leader}: You are a shift leader.
    \item \textbf{Final Year}: You have worked at least
        \minCompleteFinalYearSemeterRequirement{} complete semester(s) at the
        CSMC, in your last year before graduating, \textit{and} not pursuing any
        further education at the university
    \item \textbf{Alum}: You graduated and have worked at least
        \minCompleteFinalYearSemeterRequirement{} complete semester(s) at the
        CSMC.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Opt-out Process}

If you no longer wish to participate, please let Pratik Bhusal know.

\end{center}

\note{Due to time constraints expect at most 1 thorough critique per semeter.
Consider using the provided template to make the most out of your 1 critique.}

\section{Potential/Frequently Asked Questions}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item\QA%
        {When is the best time to apply/participate?}
        {As early as possible.}
    \item\QA%
        {How is my information stored?}
        {%
            It is stored on Google spreadsheets. Automatic data encryption is
            desired, but still in the brainstorming phase.
        }
    \item\QA%
        {What is the easiest way to contact Pratik Bhusal about the program?}
        {%
            There are two ways:

            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Create a new issue on the git repository associated with
                    the program.
                \item Send an email associated with this
                    program.\\\textbf{Hint:} repository-name (at) fullname (dot) com

            \end{enumerate}

            If you have a general question applicable to more than just you,
            prefer using option 1.

            If you have a specific question that pertains only to your
            situation, use option 2.
        }
    \item\QA%
        {How many times can I request my resume to be critiqued per semester?}
        {%
            1 time per semeter. Exceptions can be made depending on Pratik's
            schedule, but the chance of that happening is very low.
        }
    \item\QA%
        {Why are the requirements harder to achieve a resume critique than a
        referral request?}
        {%
            It takes more time and energy to complete a resume critique than it
            does to send referral requests.
        }
\end{enumerate}
