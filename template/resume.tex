\section{Miscellaneous Tips/Tricks/Hints}%{{{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Note:} This section should not be in the final version of your resume.
This section exists only to help you write the above actual sections that you
will present to companies.

\subsection*{Guidelines for Writing Experience \& Project Bullet Points}
The first bullet point should effectively be a sales pitch. It should tell me
why the project worthy of being put on the resume and hook the recruiter into
what you are capable of doing. After that, provide the details of what you
worked on.

\medskip

For writing both a good sales pitch bullet point and the following details
bullet point(s), there are handful of way to writing them. Here are some
approaches I am aware of:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item (What did you accomplish?) - (Do you have any numbers to back up the
        importance of your accomplishment?) - (How did you achieve what you
        accomplished?)
    \item (What did you accomplish?) - (What tool/technique(s) did you use?) -
        (how was the tool/technique(s) used to accomplish the feat?)
    \item (What did you accomplish?)  - (why did you do it?) - (how did you
        accomplish it?)
    \item (What did you accomplish?)  - (how did you accomplish it?)
\end{enumerate}

The key point is that you always state what you accomplished and how you did it.
Prefer using approaches 1--3. Use approach 4 as a last resort.
